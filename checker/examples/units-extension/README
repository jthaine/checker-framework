This directory shows how to create:
 * a new kind, @Frequency
 * a new unit, Hertz (@Hz)
 * a unit Kilohertz (@kHz) which is an alias annotation of @Hz(Prefix.kilo):
    using @kHz has the same effect as using @Hz(Prefix.kilo) in source code
 * relations that enforce that Hertz is computed as scalar / second,
    and that Kilohertz is computed as scalar / millisecond

You can model your own new units and unit checkers after it.

To see the demo, run: make demo
